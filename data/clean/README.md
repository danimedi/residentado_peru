`final_data.csv` contains the final data set, the other data sets are intermediate files in the process (check the code to look how this files are created).

`deidentified_data.csv` contains all the information, but without first names and last names (and randomized). However, it is not completely deidentified, individuals can be identified again by other means, anyway the original data is public.
